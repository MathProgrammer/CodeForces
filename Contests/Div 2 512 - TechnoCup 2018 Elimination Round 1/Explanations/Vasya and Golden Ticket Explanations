Now if the question was asking if there is some way to break it into 2 segments of equal sums, it would be a pretty easy question ... we'd just need to look for a prefix who's sum = S/2. 

-------------------------

Let us break it down into a smaller question ...

Given K, how do we check if A can be divided into K segments each of who's sums are equal.

If the sum of the array is S, then the sum of each segment should be S/K. (S should be divisible by K.)

-------------------------------------

That means we must search for some prefix who's sum = S/k. 

Then remove that prefix, and once again look for a prefix who's sum = S/k. 

We keep doing this ... If at any point our sum exceeds S/k, then it means we can't divide the array into segments who's sum is K because the current segment will always have sum > k.

----------------------------------

int possible_to_divide(vector <int> &A, int target_no_of_parts)
{
    int sum = 0;
    for(int i = 1; i < A.size(); i++)
        sum += A[i];

    int target_part_sum = sum/target_no_of_parts;

    int parts_that_are_made = 0;

    for(int current_part_sum = 0, i = 1; i < A.size(); i++)
    {
        current_part_sum += A[i];

        if(current_part_sum == target_part_sum)
        {
            parts_that_are_made++;

            current_part_sum = 0;
        }

        if(current_part_sum > target_part_sum)
            return false;
    }

    return (parts_that_are_made == target_no_of_parts);
}

-----------------------------

So first find Sum S, and then iterate over all divisors of S.
