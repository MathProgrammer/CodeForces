Small, but very brave, mouse Brain was not accepted to summer school of young villains. He was upset and decided to postpone his plans of taking over the world, 
but to become a photographer instead.

As you may know, the coolest photos are on the film (because you can specify the hashtag #film for such).

Brain took a lot of colourful pictures on colored and black-and-white film. Then he developed and translated it into a digital form. But now, color and black-and-white photos are in one folder, 
and to sort them, one needs to spend more than one hour!

As soon as Brain is a photographer not programmer now, he asks you to help him determine for a single photo whether it is colored or black-and-white.

Photo can be represented as a matrix sized n × m, and each element of the matrix stores a symbol indicating corresponding pixel color. There are only 6 colors:

'C' (cyan)
'M' (magenta)
'Y' (yellow)
'W' (white)
'G' (grey)
'B' (black)
The photo is considered black-and-white if it has only white, black and grey pixels in it. If there are any of cyan, magenta or yellow pixels in the photo 
then it is considered colored.

----------------------------------------------------

Simple implementation ... But I got a wrong answer because I had forgotten to put a space in front of scanf while scanning a character ... It reads the whitespace too

-------------------------------

    for(int row = 1; row <= no_of_rows; row++)
    {
        for(int column = 1; column <= no_of_columns; column++)
        {
            char colour;
            scanf(" %c", &colour);

            if(colour != 'B' && colour != 'G' && colour != 'W')
                is_colourful = true;
        }
    }

    printf(is_colourful ? "#Color\n" : "#Black&White\n");
