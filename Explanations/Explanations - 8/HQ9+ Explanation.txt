HQ9+ is a joke programming language which has only four one-character instructions:

"H" prints "Hello, World!",
"Q" prints the source code of the program itself,
"9" prints the lyrics of "99 Bottles of Beer" song,
"+" increments the value stored in the internal accumulator.
Instructions "H" and "Q" are case-sensitive and must be uppercase. The characters of the program which are not instructions are ignored.

You are given a program written in HQ9+. You have to figure out whether executing this program will produce any output.

Input
The input will consist of a single line p which will give a program in HQ9+. String p will contain between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive. 
ASCII-code of each character of p will be between 33 (exclamation mark) and 126 (tilde), inclusive.

Output
Output "YES", if executing the program will produce any output, and "NO" otherwise.

int main()
{
    bool produces_output = false;
    char program[MAX_LENGTH];
    scanf("%s", program);

    for(int i = 0; program[i] != '\0'; i++)
    {
        if(program[i] == 'H' || program[i] == 'Q' || program[i] == '9')
        {
            produces_output = true;
            break;
        }
    }

    printf(produces_output ? "YES\n" : "NO\n");
    return 0;
}
