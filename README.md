This repository is a notebook consisting of all my solutions to questions from CodeForces.

It is divided into two sections. 
The folder 'Explanation' consists of text files which document
my take on the problem, the algorithm used and test cases where the program didn't work initially.

The actual working programs are also available.

For simplicity of viewing, I have tried to ensure that no folder has more than 25 files.
Grouping is also done because there are significant changes in my programming style over time. 

My handle is `ghoshsai5000`
